			<h2>Wicker Park - Cleaning and Awareness</h2>
			<p>Unfortunately, a lot of people don't respect public and green areas. But if none of us take any action to prevent our living areas to become more and more polluted, we'll just live in a dirty and unhealthy environment. We're also working on bringing awareness to different issues related to the environmrnt, and we've seen a clear improvement (in terms of pollution in our parks) over the past years.</p>
